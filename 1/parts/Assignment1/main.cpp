#include <iostream>
//line 1 refers to the input/output library
using namespace std;
// line 3 makes our code more smaller, instead of writing everytime std::cout we simply write cout.
//entrance to the main function with entrance arrays and integer variable as i understood integer variable is needed to define the 
//size of the array;
int main (int argc , char** argv)
{
	cout <<"Hello world" << endl;
	//line  prints out word hello world . cout implies to start printing and endl end of the printing string.
